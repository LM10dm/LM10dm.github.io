This is the main index for all of my software projects. While one of my project is still in development, I will utilize github for free hosting where I can easily track all my projects and what the progress is.
At the end this main page will have a list of all my operating websites and softwares and their urls as well as how far in completion each is.
More importantly though this will be my main page for all things coding and people will be able to see a shorthand resume of my coding projects.
